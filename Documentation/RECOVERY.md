# Cryologger Glacier Velocity Tracker – Recovery Guide  

**Version 1.0**  
**Date: 2025-07-17**  

## Introduction

This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions for safely recovering a Cryologger Glacier Velocity Tracker (GVT) system. It is designed for use by field teams, including those with limited technical experience. The recovery process follows the same order that tasks should be performed on site. Each step includes notes to protect the equipment, ensure team safety, and secure the data collected by the system.

## System Description

The Cryologger GVT is a low-cost, open-source GNSS logging system designed for long-term deployment in remote polar environments. It includes a tripod-mounted GNSS antenna and solar panel, with a weatherproof enclosure housing a sealed lead-acid battery, solar charge controller, and custom electronics (Figure 1). Once deployed, the system records high-precision GNSS positions used for calculating daily glacier velocity.

## 1. Arrival, Observation, and Documentation

- [ ] Arrive at the recovery location and visually assess the system’s overall condition.
- [ ] Take clear, well-framed photos of the setup *as found*, including all sides and components.
- [ ] Look for signs of damage or disturbance, including:
  - [ ] Wildlife interference (e.g. chewed or frayed cables)
  - [ ] Tripod that has tipped over or become unstable
  - [ ] Water inside the enclosure or ice buildup
  - [ ] Severed, loose, or exposed wires or cables

## 2. Power Management and Disconnection

- [ ] Open the main enclosure and check for signs of moisture, corrosion, or damage.
- [ ] Take clear photos of the inside before touching any components.
- [ ] Look for the LED indicator on the Cryologger unit — it should blink once every 10 seconds.
- [ ] Use a multimeter to measure and record the battery voltage: ________ V
- [ ] Use a Phillips screwdriver to remove the lid from the Cryologger electronics enclosure (4 screws).
- [ ] Disconnect the 2-pin power connector to safely shut down the system.
- [ ] Reattach the plastic lid to protect the electronics during transport.
- [ ] Unscrew the two terminals labelled "PANEL +/-" on the solar charge controller.
  - [ ] ⚠️ Warning: Cover the exposed wire ends with electrical tape. These may still carry voltage.
- [ ] Loosen the cable gland at the bottom of the enclosure and remove the solar panel cable.
- [ ] The battery can stay inside the enclosure during transport if preferred.

## 3. Tripod Disassembly

- [ ] Disconnect the GNSS cable, then remove the GNSS antenna from the top of the mast.

- [ ] Use a 1/2" socket or wrench to remove the U-bolts securing the solar panel.
- [ ] Remove the radiation shield by unscrewing the hose clamp on the tripod mast.
- [ ] Use a 7/16" socket or wrench to remove the U-bolts securing the enclosure to the tripod.
  - [ ] ⚠️ Warning: The enclosure is heavy. Two people may be needed to lower it safely.
- [ ] Use a 7/16" socket or wrench to loosen the U-bolts on the tripod legs.
- [ ] Use a 1/2" socket or wrench to loosen the U-bolts on the centre mast and slide the mast out.
- [ ] Collapse the tripod and organize all components for helicopter transport.

## 4. Return to the Ship

- [ ] Carefully load and transport all recovered equipment.
- [ ] Once aboard the *Amundsen*, disconnect the battery by unscrewing the terminal bolts and removing the ring terminals.
  - [ ] ⚠️ Warning: Handle the battery wires with caution — they may still be live.
- [ ] Reinsert and tighten the battery terminal screws to prevent loss during storage.
- [ ] Store all recovered equipment securely inside the **MetOcean container** on the upper deck of the *Amundsen*.

**Note:** Always wear gloves when handling battery leads or electrical terminals. Ensure that all exposed wires are insulated to prevent short circuits or accidental discharge.

## Safety Risks and Hazards

Field recovery operations involve several potential hazards. Always prioritise personal safety and use appropriate protective gear.

**Electrical hazards**  
- Battery terminals and solar panel leads may remain live even after the system is powered down.  
- Cover exposed wires with electrical tape to prevent short circuits.

**Environmental hazards**  
- Slippery or unstable glacier surfaces can increase the risk of falls.  
- Use crampons or microspikes where appropriate.  
- Be cautious near crevasses and meltwater channels and pools.
- If the glacier is snow-covered, use an avalanche probe to establish a safe path to the system.

**Heavy equipment**  
- The enclosure is heavy and may shift unexpectedly during disassembly.  
- Work in pairs when lifting or lowering large components to avoid strain or injury.

**Helicopter operations**  
- Follow all safety protocols when approaching or loading gear into the helicopter.  
- Ensure all equipment is properly secured before takeoff or landing.
